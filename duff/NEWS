                Alternative NEWS

                * In order to support the append-only model of
                this package, each NEWS post is stored in a
                separate file, named for the date of the post.
                * For example, if there were NEWS for November 5,
                1955, it would be found in one of the package
                subdirectories (or installation subdirectories)
                in a file named NEWS--1955-11-05.
                * There should be a NEWS file with a date
                matching the Date field of the DESCRIPTION file.
