                Why Make this Package?

    A:

                Although it seems to me that many thought he was
                joking, Joe Armstrong has suggested [AJCSGP]:

                        "We should throw away all names and use
                        "cryptographic checksums to name things
                        "and life would be a lot easier.  [There
                        "is an outburst of laughter from the
                        "audience.] Well of course it would....
                        "[more laughter, and more widespread]
                        "You start naming things...  name a
                        "file...  what should I call this
                        file...  what directory should I put it
                        "in...  what machine should I put it
                        "in...  stick it all in the same
                        "directory.  Name it by its SHA and then
                        "there is no problem."

                  This package is one response to Armstrong's
                suggestion. The strategy is to create a new UUID
                for each file to be stored, wrap that file in a
                directory whose name matches the UUID, and store
                the corresponding directories in a systematic
                way.
                  Reminder: Files stored in this manner might be
                represented elsewhere by hard links or symbolic
                links.  Conversely, the files stored by UUID
                might be themselves symbolic links.
